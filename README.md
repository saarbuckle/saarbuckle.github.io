# Personal Webpage
This repo is my personal webpage ([saarbuckle.com](https://saarbuckle.com/)). In an effort to learn and practice, I've made the site from scratch instead of using a pre-built template or stylesheet. I am continually playing with it, and so some parts probably do not adhere to *best* practices.

## To do:
* change nav bar from div to nav element, set up more mobile-friendly nav bar
