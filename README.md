# Personal Webpage
This repo is my personal webpage. In an effort to learn and practice, I've made the site from scratch instead of using a pre-built template or stylesheet. For this reason, it is far from perfect and probably does not reflect the best practices.

## To do:
* add research page
* implement nav bar (bootstrap)
