				<p class="reg">I am interested in how primates are able to perform highly complex hand movements. Skillful hand use reflects intelligent integration of tactile sensory information with motor plans. In my PhD work, I have focused on the role of the primary sensorimotor cortices in hand control: both from the perspectives of motor control and tactile sensory integration. My research approach reflects my belief that impactful science is the product of a multi-faceted research program.</p>
				<p class="reg">The relative complexity of hand use varies across primate species. In my research, I leverage this variation by using multiple species and different measurement modalities to better understand the neural mechanisms that underlie aspects of skillful hand use. I currently use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans and anesthetized non-human primates (NHPs), and neural spiking data from behaving NHPs. Chiefly, I try to capitalize on the fundamental differences between fMRI and spiking data (namely, the biological origins of these signals and their respective spatial scales) to make inferences on hand control. To this end, I use computational approaches in my analyses, some of which I have helped develop.</p>
